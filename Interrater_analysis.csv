A,10,The American Naturalist,2012,0,meas/obs,table,4,.txt,1,0,R,1,0,1,1,0,"There is insufficient information in the data description boxes; several column headings are not explained and units are not specified. Some of the data are incomprehensible (e.g. date, time of day). It is extremely difficult if not impossible to identify what the archived data corresponds to in the paper; which data were used for which analyses (e.g. path analysis)? Several variables appear to be missing from the field data file: wing area and femur length (what does size correspond to?); number of spermatophores;  oviposition; initial female egg load. Discovered from reading the methods that the field variables are archived only in standardized format (see p 467 in the paper). What do the headings mean in host quality.txt? (fresh1, fresh2, height 1,height 2, …). Raw data are missing for ID of host plant species."

There is no information on the identity of the seals for which the data are archived and no description of column headings or of the values entered. Some columns are missing headings. Genetic data: it appears that 8 microsatellite loci are archived for only 31 of the 338 porpoises sampled. The excel file indicates 'Norwegian Harbor Porpoise' but there are no data for porpoise from Danish and British waters. Morphological data: the authors measured sixteen characters on 462 porpoise skulls. These data are not archived.
